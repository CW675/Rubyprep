# 1. 
x = 2
# the variable x is being asigned to 2

# 2. 
puts x = 2
# the variable x is being asigned to 2, however the puts method 
#will always evaluate to nil after returning 2.

# 3.
p name = "Joe"
# we are assigning the variable name to the string "Joe"
# The p in front will output the argument and then 
# return the argument. In this case "Joe" is the argument
# so we would expect it to return Joe twice.

# 4.
four = "four"
# assigning the variable four to the string "four"

# 5.
print something = "nothing"
#assigning "nothing" to the variable something and then using 
# the method print to print it to the screen.
